## AR-VAE: Attribute-based Regularization of VAE Latent Spaces

### About 
AR-VAE is a type of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) which uses a new supervised training method to create structured latent spaces where specific continuous-valued attributes are forced to be encoded along specific dimensions of the latent space. This repository contains the source for training and evaluating the AR-VAE models across different image and music-based datasets.

The figure below shows the main idea behind the AR-VAE model.

### Results

**Manipulation of Image Attributes**

Manipulating attributes of 2-d shapes. Each row in the figure below represents a unique shape (from top to bottom): <i>square, heart, ellipse</i>. Each column corresponds to traversal along a regularized dimension which encodes a specific attribute (from left to right): *Shape, Scale, Orientation, x-position, y-position*.

Manipulating attributes of MNIST digits. Each row in the figure below represents a unique digit fronm 0 to 9. Each column corresponds to traversal along a regularized dimension which encodes a specific attribute (from left to right): *Area, Length, Thickness, Slant, Width, Height*.

**Manipulation of Musical Attributes**

Manipulating attributes of monophonic measures of music. In the figure below, measures on each staff line are generated by traversal along a regularized dimension which encodes a specific musical attribute (shown on the extreme left).
